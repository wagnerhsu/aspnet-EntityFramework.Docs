## Entity Framework Docs

This project contains the source for EF Core and EF6 documentation located at [docs.microsoft.com/ef](https://docs.microsoft.com/ef/). 

Documentation issues for both EF Core and EF6 should be filed in this repo. Product issues (bugs) should be filed in the [EF Core repo](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore) or the [EF6 repo](https://github.com/dotnet/ef6) as appropriate.

**We accept pull requests!**
