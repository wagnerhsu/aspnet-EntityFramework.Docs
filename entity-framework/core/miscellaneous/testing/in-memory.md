# Testing with InMemory

The InMemory provider is useful when you want to test components using something that approximates connecting to the real database, without the overhead of actual database operations.

> [!TIP]  
> You can view this article's [sample](https://github.com/dotnet/EntityFramework.Docs/tree/master/samples/core/Miscellaneous/Testing) on GitHub.

## InMemory is not a relational database

EF Core database providers do not have to be relational databases. InMemory is designed to be a general purpose database for testing, and is not designed to mimic a relational database.

Some examples of this include:

* InMemory will allow you to save data that would violate referential integrity constraints in a relational database.
* If you use DefaultValueSql(string) for a property in your model, this is a relational database API and will have no effect when running against InMemory.
* [Concurrency via Timestamp/row version](xref:core/modeling/concurrency#timestamprowversion) (`[Timestamp]` or `IsRowVersion`) is not supported. No [DbUpdateConcurrencyException](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.entityframeworkcore.dbupdateconcurrencyexception) will be thrown if an update is done using an old concurrency token.

> [!TIP]  
> For many test purposes these differences will not matter. However, if you want to test against something that behaves more like a true relational database, then consider using [SQLite in-memory mode](sqlite.md).

## Example testing scenario

Consider the following service that allows application code to perform some operations related to blogs. Internally it uses a `DbContext` that connects to a SQL Server database. It would be useful to swap this context to connect to an InMemory database so that we can write efficient tests for this service without having to modify the code, or do a lot of work to create a test double of the context.

## Get your context ready

### Avoid configuring two database providers

In your tests you are going to externally configure the context to use the InMemory provider. If you are configuring a database provider by overriding `OnConfiguring` in your context, then you need to add some conditional code to ensure that you only configure the database provider if one has not already been configured.

[!code-csharp[Main](../../../../samples/core/Miscellaneous/Testing/BusinessLogic/BloggingContext.cs#OnConfiguring)]

> [!TIP]  
> If you are using ASP.NET Core, then you should not need this code since your database provider is already configured outside of the context (in Startup.cs).

### Add a constructor for testing

The simplest way to enable testing against a different database is to modify your context to expose a constructor that accepts a `DbContextOptions<TContext>`.

[!code-csharp[Main](../../../../samples/core/Miscellaneous/Testing/BusinessLogic/BloggingContext.cs#Constructors)]

> [!TIP]  
> `DbContextOptions<TContext>` tells the context all of its settings, such as which database to connect to. This is the same object that is built by running the OnConfiguring method in your context.

## Writing tests

The key to testing with this provider is the ability to tell the context to use the InMemory provider, and control the scope of the in-memory database. Typically you want a clean database for each test method.

Here is an example of a test class that uses the InMemory database. Each test method specifies a unique database name, meaning each method has its own InMemory database.

>[!TIP]
> To use the `.UseInMemoryDatabase()` extension method, reference the NuGet package [Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.InMemory](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.InMemory/).
