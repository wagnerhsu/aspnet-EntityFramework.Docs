# Using a Separate Migrations Project

You may want to store your migrations in a different assembly than the one containing your `DbContext`. You can also use this strategy to maintain multiple sets of migrations, for example, one for development and another for release-to-release upgrades.

To do this...

1. Create a new class library.

2. Add a reference to your DbContext assembly.

3. Move the migrations and model snapshot files to the class library.
   > [!TIP]
   > If you have no existing migrations, generate one in the project containing the DbContext then move it.
   > This is important because if the migrations assembly does not contain an existing migration, the Add-Migration command will be unable to find the DbContext.

4. Configure the migrations assembly:

   ``` csharp
   options.UseSqlServer(
       connectionString,
       x => x.MigrationsAssembly("MyApp.Migrations"));
   ```

5. Add a reference to your migrations assembly from the startup assembly.
   * If this causes a circular dependency, update the output path of the class library:

     ``` xml
     <PropertyGroup>
       <OutputPath>..\MyStartupProject\bin\$(Configuration)\</OutputPath>
     </PropertyGroup>
     ```

If you did everything correctly, you should be able to add new migrations to the project.

## [.NET Core CLI](#tab/dotnet-core-cli)

```dotnetcli
dotnet ef migrations add NewMigration --project MyApp.Migrations
```

## [Visual Studio](#tab/vs)

``` powershell
Add-Migration NewMigration -Project MyApp.Migrations
```
