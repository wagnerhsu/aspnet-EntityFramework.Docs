# EF Core Azure Cosmos DB Provider

> [!NOTE]
> This provider is new in EF Core 3.0.

This database provider allows Entity Framework Core to be used with Azure Cosmos DB. The provider is maintained as part of the [Entity Framework Core Project](https://github.com/aspnet/EntityFrameworkCore).

It is strongly recommended to familiarize yourself with the [Azure Cosmos DB documentation](/azure/cosmos-db/introduction) before reading this section.

> [!NOTE]
> This provider only works with the SQL API of Azure Cosmos DB.

## Install

Install the [Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Cosmos NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Cosmos/).

### [.NET Core CLI](#tab/dotnet-core-cli)

```dotnetcli
dotnet add package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Cosmos
```

### [Visual Studio](#tab/vs)

``` powershell
Install-Package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Cosmos
```

***

## Get started

> [!TIP]  
> You can view this article's [sample on GitHub](https://github.com/dotnet/EntityFramework.Docs/tree/master/samples/core/Cosmos).

Like for other providers the first step is to call [UseCosmos](/dotnet/api/Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.CosmosDbContextOptionsExtensions.UseCosmos):

[!code-csharp[Configuration](../../../../samples/core/Cosmos/ModelBuilding/OrderContext.cs?name=Configuration)]

> [!WARNING]
> The endpoint and key are hardcoded here for simplicity, but in a production app these should be [stored securely](/aspnet/core/security/app-secrets#secret-manager).

In this example `Order` is a simple entity with a reference to the [owned type](../../modeling/owned-entities.md) `StreetAddress`.

[!code-csharp[Order](../../../../samples/core/Cosmos/ModelBuilding/Order.cs?name=Order)]

[!code-csharp[StreetAddress](../../../../samples/core/Cosmos/ModelBuilding/StreetAddress.cs?name=StreetAddress)]

Saving and quering data follows the normal EF pattern:

[!code-csharp[HelloCosmos](../../../../samples/core/Cosmos/ModelBuilding/Sample.cs?name=HelloCosmos)]

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Calling [EnsureCreatedAsync](/dotnet/api/Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Storage.IDatabaseCreator.EnsureCreatedAsync) is necessary to create the required containers and insert the [seed data](../../modeling/data-seeding.md) if present in the model. However `EnsureCreatedAsync` should only be called during deployment, not normal operation, as it may cause performance issues.

## Cosmos-specific model customization

By default all entity types are mapped to the same container, named after the derived context (`"OrderContext"` in this case). To change the default container name use [HasDefaultContainer](/dotnet/api/Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.CosmosModelBuilderExtensions.HasDefaultContainer):

[!code-csharp[DefaultContainer](../../../../samples/core/Cosmos/ModelBuilding/OrderContext.cs?name=DefaultContainer)]

To map an entity type to a different container use [ToContainer](/dotnet/api/Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.CosmosEntityTypeBuilderExtensions.ToContainer):

[!code-csharp[Container](../../../../samples/core/Cosmos/ModelBuilding/OrderContext.cs?name=Container)]

To identify the entity type that a given item represent EF Core adds a discriminator value even if there are no derived entity types. The name and value of the discriminator [can be changed](../../modeling/inheritance.md).

If no other entity type will ever be stored in the same container the discriminator can be removed by calling [HasNoDiscriminator](/dotnet/api/Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Metadata.Builders.EntityTypeBuilder.HasNoDiscriminator):

[!code-csharp[NoDiscriminator](../../../../samples/core/Cosmos/ModelBuilding/OrderContext.cs?name=NoDiscriminator)]

### Partition keys

By default EF Core will create containers with the partition key set to `"__partitionKey"` without supplying any value for it when inserting items. But to fully leverage the performance capabilities of Azure Cosmos a [carefully selected partition key](/azure/cosmos-db/partition-data) should be used. It can be configured by calling [HasPartitionKey](/dotnet/api/Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.CosmosEntityTypeBuilderExtensions.HasPartitionKey):

[!code-csharp[PartitionKey](../../../../samples/core/Cosmos/ModelBuilding/OrderContext.cs?name=PartitionKey)]

> [!NOTE]
>The partition key property can be of any type as long as it is [converted to string](xref:core/modeling/value-conversions).

Once configured the partition key property should always have a non-null value. When issuing a query a condition can be added to make it single-partition.

[!code-csharp[PartitionKey](../../../../samples/core/Cosmos/ModelBuilding/Sample.cs?name=PartitionKey)]

## Embedded entities

For Cosmos owned entities are embedded in the same item as the owner. To change a property name use [ToJsonProperty](/dotnet/api/Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.CosmosEntityTypeBuilderExtensions.ToJsonProperty):

[!code-csharp[PropertyNames](../../../../samples/core/Cosmos/ModelBuilding/OrderContext.cs?name=PropertyNames)]

With this configuration the order from the example above is stored like this:

``` json
{
    "Id": 1,
    "PartitionKey": "1",
    "TrackingNumber": null,
    "id": "1",
    "Address": {
        "ShipsToCity": "London",
        "ShipsToStreet": "221 B Baker St"
    },
    "_rid": "6QEKAM+BOOABAAAAAAAAAA==",
    "_self": "dbs/6QEKAA==/colls/6QEKAM+BOOA=/docs/6QEKAM+BOOABAAAAAAAAAA==/",
    "_etag": "\"00000000-0000-0000-683c-692e763901d5\"",
    "_attachments": "attachments/",
    "_ts": 1568163674
}
```

Collections of owned entities are embedded as well. For the next example we'll use the `Distributor` class with a collection of `StreetAddress`:

[!code-csharp[Distributor](../../../../samples/core/Cosmos/ModelBuilding/Distributor.cs?name=Distributor)]

The owned entities don't need to provide explicit key values to be stored:

[!code-csharp[OwnedCollection](../../../../samples/core/Cosmos/ModelBuilding/Sample.cs?name=OwnedCollection)]

They will be persisted in this way:

``` json
{
    "Id": 1,
    "Discriminator": "Distributor",
    "id": "Distributor|1",
    "ShippingCenters": [
        {
            "City": "Phoenix",
            "Street": "500 S 48th Street"
        },
        {
            "City": "Anaheim",
            "Street": "5650 Dolly Ave"
        }
    ],
    "_rid": "6QEKANzISj0BAAAAAAAAAA==",
    "_self": "dbs/6QEKAA==/colls/6QEKANzISj0=/docs/6QEKANzISj0BAAAAAAAAAA==/",
    "_etag": "\"00000000-0000-0000-683c-7b2b439701d5\"",
    "_attachments": "attachments/",
    "_ts": 1568163705
}
```

Internally EF Core always needs to have unique key values for all tracked entities. The primary key created by default for collections of owned types consists of the foreign key properties pointing to the owner and an `int` property corresponding to the index in the JSON array. To retrieve these values entry API could be used:

[!code-csharp[ImpliedProperties](../../../../samples/core/Cosmos/ModelBuilding/Sample.cs?name=ImpliedProperties)]

> [!TIP]
> When necessary the default primary key for the owned entity types can be changed, but then key values should be provided explicitly.

## Working with disconnected entities

Every item needs to have an `id` value that is unique for the given partition key. By default EF Core generates the value by concatenating the discriminator and the primary key values, using '|' as a delimiter. The key values are only generated when an entity enters the `Added` state. This might pose a problem when [attaching entities](../../saving/disconnected-entities.md) if they don't have an `id` property on the .NET type to store the value.

To work around this limitation one could create and set the `id` value manually or mark the entity as added first, then changing it to the desired state:

[!code-csharp[Attach](../../../../samples/core/Cosmos/ModelBuilding/Sample.cs?highlight=4&name=Attach)]

This is the resulting JSON:

``` json
{
    "Id": 1,
    "Discriminator": "Distributor",
    "id": "Distributor|1",
    "ShippingCenters": [
        {
            "City": "Phoenix",
            "Street": "500 S 48th Street"
        }
    ],
    "_rid": "JBwtAN8oNYEBAAAAAAAAAA==",
    "_self": "dbs/JBwtAA==/colls/JBwtAN8oNYE=/docs/JBwtAN8oNYEBAAAAAAAAAA==/",
    "_etag": "\"00000000-0000-0000-9377-d7a1ae7c01d5\"",
    "_attachments": "attachments/",
    "_ts": 1572917100
}
```
