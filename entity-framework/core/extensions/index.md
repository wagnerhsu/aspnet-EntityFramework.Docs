# EF Core Tools & Extensions

These tools and extensions provide additional functionality for Entity Framework Core 2.1 and later.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Extensions are built by a variety of sources and aren't maintained as part of the Entity Framework Core project. When considering a third party extension, be sure to evaluate its quality, licensing, compatibility, support, etc. to ensure it meets your requirements. In particular, an extension built for an older version of EF Core may need updating before it will work with the latest versions.

## Tools

### LLBLGen Pro

LLBLGen Pro is an entity modeling solution with support for Entity Framework and Entity Framework Core. It lets you easily define your entity model and map it to your database, using database first or model first, so you can get started writing queries right away. For EF Core: 2.

[Website](https://www.llblgen.com/)

### Devart Entity Developer

Entity Developer is a powerful ORM designer for ADO.NET Entity Framework, NHibernate, LinqConnect, Telerik Data Access, and LINQ to SQL. It supports designing EF Core models visually, using model first or database first approaches, and C# or Visual Basic code generation. For EF Core: 2.

### nHydrate ORM for Entity Framework

An ORM that creates strongly-typed, extendable classes for Entity Framework. The generated code is Entity Framework Core. There is no difference. This is not a replacement for EF or a custom ORM. It is a visual, modeling layer that allows a team to manage complex database schemas. It works well with SCM software like Git, allowing multi-user access to your model with minimal conflicts. The installer tracks model changes and creates upgrade scripts. For EF Core: 3.

### EF Core Power Tools

EF Core Power Tools is a Visual Studio extension that exposes various EF Core design-time tasks in a simple user interface. It includes reverse engineering of DbContext and entity classes from existing databases and [SQL Server DACPACs](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/relational-databases/data-tier-applications/data-tier-applications), management of database migrations, and model visualizations. For EF Core: 2, 3.

### Entity Framework Visual Editor

Entity Framework Visual Editor is a Visual Studio extension that adds an ORM designer for visual design of EF 6, and EF Core classes. Code is generated using T4 templates so can be customized to suit any needs. It supports inheritance, unidirectional and bidirectional associations, enumerations, and the ability to color-code your classes and add text blocks to explain potentially arcane parts of your design. For EF Core: 2.

### CatFactory

CatFactory is a scaffolding engine for .NET Core that can automate the generation of DbContext classes, entities, mapping configurations, and repository classes from a SQL Server database. For EF Core: 2.

[GitHub repository](https://github.com/hherzl/CatFactory.EntityFrameworkCore)

### LoreSoft's Entity Framework Core Generator

Entity Framework Core Generator (efg) is a .NET Core CLI tool that can generate EF Core models from an existing database, much like `dotnet ef dbcontext scaffold`, but it also supports safe code [regeneration](https://efg.loresoft.com/en/latest/regeneration/) via region replacement or by parsing mapping files. This tool supports generating view models, validation, and object mapper code. For EF Core: 2.
